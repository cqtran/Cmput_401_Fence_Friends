2017-09-29 Meeting with Diego
------------------------------------------------------

Comments from TA:
	Good high level class design. Would be better to include a more higher level design for the client
	Use cases good, can split use cases if needed
	Storyboard and mockups good
	Release planning: lots of use cases and not alot of people. one use case can have many activities
		Second sprint has 8 use cases rather than 5. Should be more split up, possibly by priority?
		All use cases need a test
	Glossary is good

Project changed from IOS app into web app
Platform will be Python Flask, bootstrap, web service
For drawing functionality, we will use javascript
