2017-11-09 Meeting with Jon
------------------------------------------------------
Demoed the drawing functionality (Draw.IO) to Jon

Jon has provided us with some information in the Google drive 
	including materials listing, quotation examples, and quotation 
	calculations. He will also later provide us material examples.
	Using one general email for the app is fine, and referencing the 
	fencing company's email or fencing user's email at the end of the
	quotation email to the client is fine.
	
He will use his current website for the URL and forward it to our app.
