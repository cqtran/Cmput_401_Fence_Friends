2017-09-22 Meeting with Diego
------------------------------------------------------
State progress of the week. Three questions to
answer every week:
	What did you do?
	What are you doing in the future?
	What are the problems?

Created questions for the client (On Github wiki)

Problems: Figure out what platform to use for development since
	we are not familiar with IOS and was suggested (by Victor) to use Android
	May require more time to develop the app on IOS due to lack of knowledge

No web services requirements from client. May recieve 
	extra requirements to provide web services

The complex is the drawing and we should break down drawing task.
	Need to come with a mockup for the drawing aspect of the application

Licensing depends on client. Client may not want open source project
	If the repository is required to be private, 
	then talk to TA to ask about a private repository

UML Diagrams/class diagram
	Do not try to include all classes, at most do important classes

High level architecture diagram
	Interations with APIs and functionality

Sprit 1, code wire frames is the high level diagram. Should define main functions
