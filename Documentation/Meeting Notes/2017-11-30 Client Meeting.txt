2017-11-30 Meeting with Jon
------------------------------------------------------
Demoed the app from the server
Jon was able to do a trial run through the app. We showed
him many of the major features from the user side
and admin side. He tried it from both a computer and 
iPad.

A few changes to do:
- PDF formatting
- Compatibility with an iPad (pdf and photos)
- Material listing needs to be done
