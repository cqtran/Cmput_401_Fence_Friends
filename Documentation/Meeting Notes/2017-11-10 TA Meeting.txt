Demoed what progress we have:
	In general we need mock data that looks real
	We need to ask Diego for a tablet to try out app out
	Customers page:
		Customers should be sorted somehow
		Clean UI, prettier UI or boxes? Tighter/smaller customer box UI
		Colors?
		
	Projects page:
		Can filter projects by status
		Sorted by start date. We should sort by dates
			and group by project status
		We should know the status process flow
	
	Project Info:
		Dates in order
	
	Drawing.IO:
		Gates, Fence, Buildings. Drawing saves to database
		We should make sure to scale it vertically too. Making a skinny but tall image will make it look weird
	
	Create customer -> new project (Both have addresses because a client may have multiple properties)
	Buttons should be 
	
	View quote and view material list create a pdf
	Can send an email with attached pdf to suppliers and clients
	Calculations are from rules
	
	New requirement: Create an thumbnail to make them look the same size. Clicking them will open the full image
	
	Floating text when Draw.IO is loaded may be able to be captured and hidden
